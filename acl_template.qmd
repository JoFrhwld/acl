# Introduction {#sec-intro}

This is an work-in-progress quarto template for \*ACL papers. So far the following are fairly well implemented:

-   Author blocks
-   Title blocks
-   Toggling on and off review status

Items that still need work:

-   Markdown table rendering
-   More author formats
-   Lots of other things probably
